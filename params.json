The advantages are attractive, from reproducible research to simplifying deployment of complex code.\r\nThis event will bring together some notable cases to discuss how advantage of this new technology can best be achieved within the Bioinformatics space.  \r\n\r\nDay one & two of the event will feature lightning talks from selected speakers.  \r\nDay two will additionally include an afternoon mini-hackday to introduce, demonstrate, and invite participation using Docker on some interesting and well scoped problems (you are encouraged to make suggestions for the hackday topics).\r\n\r\nThroughout the course of the event we would like to identify where common goals exist in the bioinformatics arena and explore how efforts in containerized solutions could be aligned by establishing a community of Docker users and resources (with a similar function to that of Bioconductor for R). This could include:  \r\n\r\n- Communal resopositories  \r\n- Documentation and tutorials  \r\n- Forums  \r\n\r\nJoin us for the first exclusive event that brings together discussions on dockers within Bioinformatics!\r\n\r\n**Group Webpage:**http://goo.gl/LuNWKa\r\n\r\n**Flyer:**https://goo.gl/ntC7aK\r\n\r\n**Getting There:**http://wellcomecollection.org/visit-us/getting-here\r\n\r\n**Latest Conference Agenda:**https://goo.gl/LpH07s\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\n## Aims (what we want to get out of the meeting)\r\nPlaceholder of my (snewhouse) current thoughts.
