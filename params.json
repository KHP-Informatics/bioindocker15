The advantages are attractive, from reproducible research to simplifying deployment of complex code.\r\nThis event will bring together some notable cases to discuss how advantage of this new technology can best be achieved within the Bioinformatics space.  \r\n\r\nDay one & two of the event will feature lightning talks from selected speakers.  \r\nDay two will additionally include an afternoon mini-hackday to introduce, demonstrate, and invite participation using Docker on some interesting and well scoped problems (you are encouraged to make suggestions for the hackday topics).\r\n\r\nThroughout the course of the event we would like to identify where common goals exist in the bioinformatics arena and explore how efforts in containerized solutions could be aligned by establishing a community of Docker users and resources (with a similar function to that of Bioconductor for R). This could include:  \r\n\r\n- Communal resopositories  \r\n- Documentation and tutorials  \r\n- Forums  \r\n\r\nJoin us for the first exclusive event that brings together discussions on dockers within Bioinformatics!\r\n\r\n**Group Webpage:**http://goo.gl/LuNWKa\r\n\r\n**Flyer:**https://goo.gl/ntC7aK\r\n\r\n**Getting There:**http://wellcomecollection.org/visit-us/getting-here\r\n\r\n**Latest Conference Agenda:**https://goo.gl/LpH07s\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\n## Aims (what we want to get out of the meeting)\r\nPlaceholder of my (snewhouse) current thoughts. Please contribute.  \r\n\r\n- Index of Docker/VM Bioinformatics projetcs  \r\n- F1000 Channel, Editorial and Slide Share    \r\n- API  \r\n- Adapt/Adopt [CWL](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/common-workflow-language) for multi component Docker pipelines  \r\n- RFC  \r\n- ...\r\n\r\n## Mini-Hacks, Demos and Tutorials\r\nI have made a start. Please contribute.\r\n\r\nTBA: List of potential ideas with [links to code](https://github.com/KHP-Informatics/bioindocker15/tree/master/hack/)\r\nClone, commit and push please.\r\n\r\n- [A hands-on introduction to Docker](https://github.com/ngs-docs/angus/blob/2015/week3/CTB_docker.rst)  \r\n- [Training in Docker from Docker](https://training.docker.com/self-paced-training)  \r\n- [rocker-org - \"rocker\": R in Docker](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker)  \r\n- Intel: Hack using docker on arduino for stream processing NGS sequence data.  \r\n- [nextflow](http://www.nextflow.io/)  \r\n- [kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/)    \r\n- Jetbrains MPS, nextflow, docker integration demo and tutorial ([Fabien Campagne](http://campagnelab.org/pi-contact/))      \r\n- Flocker by https://clusterhq.com/  \r\n- [Jetstack]()  \r\n- [weave]()  \r\n- ...\r\n\r\n## The problem with Informatic pipelines  \r\nI have made a start. Please contribute.\r\n- Reproducible ?\r\n- Mutli-component  \r\n- Each component has different dependencies (eg Python2.7 v Python3.0)\r\n- Each component written in a different Language  (python, java etc etc)\r\n- Each component has multiple options for tweaking the input and output  \r\n- Each component requires multiple inputs\r\n- Each component produces multiple outputs   \r\n- Disk I/O (pipes)  \r\n- Large files eg. for NGS  10's-100's GB per input/output  \r\n- Pipeline components often require access to large shared data and databases (eg NGS Reference Genomes and annotation files)\r\n- Binaries not often available, requires build from source  \r\n- Not easy to set up and reproduce for non-informaticians  \r\n- *Can be hard for informaticians if code is bad, dependency heavy, undocumented or requires very specific versions of OS's and software etc*\r\n- Often Suffers from: *\"But It works on my Machine??\"*  \r\n\r\n## Security  \r\n- [Docker security](https://docs.docker.com/articles/security/)  \r\n- [Hypervisor-agnostic Docker Engine_](https://hyper.sh/)  \r\n- ...\r\n\r\nSome random thoughts...  \r\n**Only trusted users should be allowed 1) Access to HPC and 2) To control your Docker daemon**.  \r\nWho is the malicious Hacker that will delete all files and take down your system or make it all public?\r\nLets make breaches of security a criminal offence.\r\nIn the Academic (Bio)Informatic world, most users are basic or clinician scientists with little computer skill.\r\nWe the sys. admins and trusted informaticians should set up the pipelines and provide users with push button solutions. We should control what gets run and when, so that all a user has to do is log in and select a pipeline to run on their data.\r\n\r\n## Index of Dockered & Related Projects for Informatics  \r\nI have made a start.
