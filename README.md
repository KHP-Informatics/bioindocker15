Docker is now establishing itself as the de facto solution for containerization across a wide range of domains. The advantages are attractive, from reproducible research to simplifying deployment of complex code.
This event will bring together some notable cases to discuss how advantage of this new technology can best be achieved within the Bioinformatics space.  

Day one & two of the event will feature lightning talks from selected speakers.  
Day two will additionally include an afternoon mini-hackday to introduce, demonstrate, and invite participation using Docker on some interesting and well scoped problems (you are encouraged to make suggestions for the hackday topics).

Throughout the course of the event we would like to identify where common goals exist in the bioinformatics arena and explore how efforts in containerized solutions could be aligned by establishing a community of Docker users and resources (with a similar function to that of Bioconductor for R). This could include:  

- Communal resopositories  
- Documentation and tutorials  
- Forums  

Join us for the first exclusive event that brings together discussions on dockers within Bioinformatics!
